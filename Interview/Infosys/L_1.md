## 1. 5 Ways of Component Communication in Angular
1. **@Input() and @Output()** â€” Parent to child and child to parent.
2. **Shared Service with Observables/Subjects** â€” Cross-component.
3. **ViewChild / ViewChildren** â€” Directly access child component properties/methods.
4. **Router Parameters** â€” Pass data through routes.
5. **State Management Tools (NgRx, Akita)** â€” Centralized app state.

**Example:**
```typescript
// parent.component.html
<child-comp [data]="parentData" (notify)="handleNotify($event)"></child-comp>
````

## 2. What is Subject and BehaviorSubject? Why we need

* **Subject** â€” Does not store last emitted value; emits to current subscribers.
* **BehaviorSubject** â€” Stores last emitted value; new subscribers immediately get it.
* **Need** â€” Useful for state sharing across components/services.

**Example:**

```typescript
const subject = new Subject<number>();
const behavior = new BehaviorSubject<number>(0);
```

## 3. How do you handle errors Globally?

* Use Angularâ€™s `ErrorHandler` service to catch all unhandled errors.
* Example:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class GlobalErrorHandler implements ErrorHandler {
  handleError(error: any) {
    console.error('Global Error:', error);
  }
}
```

## 4. Where do you store the jwt token in angular?

* **Best**: HTTP-only cookies (secure, prevents XSS).
* Alternative: `sessionStorage` (expires on tab close) > `localStorage`.

## 5. How do you pass jwt token?

* Use **HTTP Interceptors** to attach token in headers.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    const cloned = req.clone({
      setHeaders: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
    });
    return next.handle(cloned);
  }
}
```

## 7. How do you implement JWT in .NET Core

* Install `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`
* Configure in `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddJwtBearer(options =>
    {
        options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {
            ValidateIssuer = true,
            ValidateAudience = true,
            ValidateLifetime = true,
            ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true
        };
    });
```

If you **copy this into a `.md` file and view it in GitHub**,  
the **Back to Top** links will work perfectly.  

Do you want me to also prepare the **Deloitte FS L2** version in the same format so both sets are GitHub-ready?
