***

## 1. DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP Operations

### DELETE

**Definition:** Removes specific rows based on conditions while preserving table structure and indexes.

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```

- **Use case:** Selective row removal
- **Rollback:** Possible (logged operation)


### TRUNCATE

**Definition:** Removes all rows while keeping table structure, but faster than DELETE.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
```

- **Use case:** Quick table cleanup
- **Rollback:** Limited (minimally logged)


### DROP

**Definition:** Completely removes the table and all its data from the database.

```sql
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

- **Use case:** Permanent table removal
- **Rollback:** Not possible after commit

## 2. ACID Properties in Database Transactions

**Definition:** ACID represents four fundamental properties that guarantee reliable database transactions.

### Atomicity

**Definition:** Ensures all operations in a transaction succeed or all fail together.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;
COMMIT;
```


### Consistency

**Definition:** Maintains database integrity by enforcing all constraints and rules.

### Isolation

**Definition:** Prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other.

### Durability

**Definition:** Guarantees committed transactions persist even after system failures.

[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

***

## 3. Clustered vs Non-Clustered Indexes

### Clustered Index

**Definition:** Physically sorts table data based on the indexed column(s).

```sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Employees_ID ON Employees(EmployeeID);
```

- **Limitation:** One per table
- **Performance:** Faster for range queries


### Non-Clustered Index

**Definition:** Creates a separate structure with pointers to actual data rows.

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Employees_Name ON Employees(LastName);
```

- **Limitation:** Multiple allowed per table
- **Performance:** Faster for specific lookups

[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

***

## 4. SQL Join Types

**Definition:** Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.

### INNER JOIN

Returns only matching records from both tables.

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.Name
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```


### LEFT JOIN

Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right.

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.Name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```


### RIGHT JOIN

Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left.

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.Name
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```


### FULL OUTER JOIN

Returns all records when there's a match in either table.

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.Name
FROM Employees e
FULL JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```


### CROSS JOIN

Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.Name
FROM Employees e
CROSS JOIN Departments d;
```

## 5. SQL Injection Prevention

**Definition:** SQL injection is a security vulnerability where malicious SQL code is inserted into application queries.

### Vulnerable Code

```sql
-- Dangerous: Direct string concatenation
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR '1'='1' AND Password = '';
```


### Secure Code

```csharp
// Safe: Parameterized queries
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(
    "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @username AND Password = @password", 
    connection);
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@username", userInput);
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@password", userInput);
```

[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

***

## 6. Stored Procedures

**Definition:** Pre-compiled SQL code stored in the database that can be executed repeatedly.

**Benefits:** Improved security, performance, and code reusability.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployee
    @EmployeeID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;
END;

-- Execution
EXEC GetEmployee @EmployeeID = 1;
```

[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

***

## 7. Query Optimization Techniques

**Definition:** Methods to improve SQL query performance and reduce execution time.

### Use Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX IX_Employees_DepartmentID ON Employees(DepartmentID);
```


### Avoid SELECT *

```sql
-- Good: Specific columns
SELECT Name, Age FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID = 1;
```


### Prefer JOINs over Subqueries

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.Name
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

***

## 8. WHERE vs HAVING Clauses

### WHERE

**Definition:** Filters rows **before** grouping occurs.

```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees
WHERE Age > 30
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```


### HAVING

**Definition:** Filters groups **after** grouping and aggregation.

```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

    Name NVARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT
);

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName NVARCHAR(50)
);
```


### Denormalization

**Definition:** Deliberately adding redundancy to improve query performance.

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeeDetails (
    EmployeeID INT,
    Name NVARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentName NVARCHAR(50)
);
```

SELECT * FROM EmployeeCTE WHERE RowNum BETWEEN 1 AND 10;
```

[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

***

## 11. Window Functions

       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS SalaryRank
FROM Employees;
```

[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

);
```


### Composite Primary Key

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID)
);
