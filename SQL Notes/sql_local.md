 SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to manage and manipulate databases. Here^s a progression from beginner to advanced SQL concepts:

### Beginner Level

#### 1. **Introduction to SQL**
   - **Basic Concepts**: Understand databases, tables, rows, and columns.
   - **Data Types**: Common data types like `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, etc.

#### 2. **Basic SQL Statements**
   - **SELECT Statement**: Retrieve data from a table.
     ```sql
     SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
     ```
   - **WHERE Clause**: Filter records.
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
     ```
   - **INSERT Statement**: Insert new data into a table.
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
     ```
   - **UPDATE Statement**: Update existing data.
     ```sql
     UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
     ```
   - **DELETE Statement**: Remove data from a table.
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
     ```

#### 3. **Basic Functions and Clauses**
   - **ORDER BY**: Sort the result set.
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC/DESC;
     ```
   - **LIMIT**: Limit the number of rows returned.
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT number;
     ```

### Intermediate Level

#### 1. **Joins**
   - **INNER JOIN**: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
     ```sql
     SELECT columns FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
     ```
   - **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Include all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
     ```sql
     SELECT columns FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
     ```
   - **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Include all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
     ```sql
     SELECT columns FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
     ```

#### 2. **Aggregate Functions**
   - **COUNT()**: Count the number of rows.
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(column) FROM table_name;
     ```
   - **SUM()**: Sum of a numeric column.
     ```sql
     SELECT SUM(column) FROM table_name;
     ```
   - **AVG()**: Average value of a numeric column.
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(column) FROM table_name;
     ```
   - **MIN() and MAX()**: Minimum and maximum values.
     ```sql
     SELECT MIN(column), MAX(column) FROM table_name;
     ```

#### 3. **Group By and Having Clauses**
   - **GROUP BY**: Group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
     ```sql
     SELECT column1, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;
     ```
   - **HAVING**: Filter groups based on conditions.
     ```sql
     SELECT column1, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
     ```

#### 4. **Subqueries**
   - **Subquery**: A query within another query.
     ```sql
     SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE column2 = (SELECT column2 FROM another_table WHERE condition);
     ```

### Advanced Level

#### 1. **Advanced Joins**
   - **Self Join**: Join a table to itself.
     ```sql
     SELECT a.column1, b.column2 FROM table_name a INNER JOIN table_name b ON a.common_column = b.common_column;
     ```
   - **Cross Join**: Cartesian product of two tables.
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;
     ```

#### 2. **Window Functions**
   - Perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.
     ```sql
     SELECT column, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column) FROM table_name;
     ```

#### 3. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
   - Define temporary result sets that can be referred within the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
     ```sql
     WITH cte_name AS (
       SELECT column FROM table_name WHERE condition
     )
     SELECT * FROM cte_name WHERE condition;
     ```

#### 4. **Advanced Subqueries**
   - **Correlated Subquery**: Subquery that uses values from the outer query.
     ```sql
     SELECT column FROM table_name outer WHERE EXISTS (SELECT column FROM another_table inner WHERE inner.column = outer.column);
     ```

#### 5. **Indexes and Performance Tuning**
   - **Indexes**: Improve the speed of data retrieval operations.
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column);
     ```
   - **Query Optimization**: Analyze and optimize query performance using EXPLAIN plans.

#### 6. **Transactions and Concurrency**
   - **Transaction Control**: Ensure data integrity with COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.
     ```sql
     BEGIN;
     -- SQL operations
     COMMIT;
     ```
   - **Isolation Levels**: Manage how transaction integrity is visible to other transactions.

### Example:

Here^s a comprehensive example incorporating several of these concepts:

```sql
-- Create tables
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  department_id INT,
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO departments (id, department_name) VALUES (1, 'Sales'), (2, 'Engineering');
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department_id, salary) VALUES 
(1, 'Alice', 1, 50000), 
(2, 'Bob', 2, 60000),
(3, 'Charlie', 2, 70000);

-- Query with join
SELECT e.name, d.department_name, e.salary
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- Aggregate with group by
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) as average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Subquery
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

-- Common Table Expression (CTE)
WITH HighEarners AS (
  SELECT name, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary > 60000
)
SELECT * FROM HighEarners;

-- Transaction
BEGIN;
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.10 WHERE department_id = 1;
ROLLBACK;
```

--Backup existing table in SQL

In SQL Server, you need to use a slightly different approach. SQL Server does not support CREATE TABLE AS SELECT directly, but you can achieve the same effect with SELECT INTO:
SELECT *
INTO new_table
FROM existing_table;

This progression will help you build a strong foundation in SQL, allowing you to handle increasingly complex data operations and analyses effectively.
